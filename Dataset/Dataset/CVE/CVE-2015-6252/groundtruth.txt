Description
The vhost_dev_ioctl function in drivers/vhost/vhost.c in the Linux kernel before 4.1.5 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a VHOST_SET_LOG_FD ioctl call that triggers permanent file-descriptor allocation.

vhost: actually track log eventfd file
While reviewing vhost log code, I found out that log_file is never
set. Note: I haven't tested the change (QEMU doesn't use LOG_FD yet).
