Description
A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in dbFree in fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c in the journaling file system (JFS) in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a missing sanity check.

fs: jfs: fix possible NULL pointer dereference in dbFree()
In our fault-injection testing, the variable "nblocks" in dbFree() can be
zero when kmalloc_array() fails in dtSearch(). In this case, the variable
 "mp" in dbFree() would be NULL and then it is dereferenced in
"write_metapage(mp)".

The failure log is listed as follows:

This patch adds a NULL check of "mp" before "write_metapage(mp)" is called.
