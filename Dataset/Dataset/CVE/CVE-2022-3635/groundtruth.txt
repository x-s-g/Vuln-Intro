atm: idt77252: fix use-after-free bugs caused by tst_timer
There are use-after-free bugs caused by tst_timer. The root cause
is that there are no functions to stop tst_timer in idt77252_exit().
One of the possible race conditions is shown below:

    (thread 1)          |        (thread 2)
                        |  idt77252_init_one
                        |    init_card
                        |      fill_tst
                        |        mod_timer(&card->tst_timer, ...)
idt77252_exit           |  (wait a time)
                        |  tst_timer
                        |
                        |    ...
  kfree(card) // FREE   |
                        |    card->soft_tst[e] // USE

The idt77252_dev is deallocated in idt77252_exit() and used in
timer handler.

This patch adds del_timer_sync() in idt77252_exit() in order that
the timer handler could be stopped before the idt77252_dev is
deallocated.
