Description
A flaw was found in the crypto subsystem of the Linux kernel before version kernel-4.15-rc4. The "null skcipher" was being dropped when each af_alg_ctx was freed instead of when the aead_tfm was freed. This can cause the null skcipher to be freed while it is still in use leading to a local user being able to crash the system or possibly escalate privileges.

crypto: algif_aead - fix reference counting of null skcipher
In the AEAD interface for AF_ALG, the reference to the "null skcipher"
held by each tfm was being dropped in the wrong place -- when each
af_alg_ctx was freed instead of when the aead_tfm was freed.  As
discovered by syzkaller, a specially crafted program could use this to
cause the null skcipher to be freed while it is still in use.

Fix it by dropping the reference in the right place.
