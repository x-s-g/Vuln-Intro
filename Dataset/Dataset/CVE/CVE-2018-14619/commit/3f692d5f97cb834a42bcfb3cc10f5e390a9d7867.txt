-	 * AEAD memory structure: For encryption, the tag is appended to the
-	 * ciphertext which implies that the memory allocated for the ciphertext
-	 * must be increased by the tag length. For decryption, the tag
-	 * is expected to be concatenated to the ciphertext. The plaintext
-	 * therefore has a memory size of the ciphertext minus the tag length.
-	 *
-	 * The memory structure for cipher operation has the following
-	 * structure:
-	 *	AEAD encryption input:  assoc data || plaintext
-	 *	AEAD encryption output: cipherntext || auth tag
-	 *	AEAD decryption input:  assoc data || ciphertext || auth tag
-	 *	AEAD decryption output: plaintext
+	 * Please see documentation of aead_request_set_crypt for the
+	 * description of the AEAD memory structure expected from the caller.
