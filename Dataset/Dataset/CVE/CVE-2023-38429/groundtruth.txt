Description
An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.4. fs/ksmbd/connection.c in ksmbd has an off-by-one error in memory allocation (because of ksmbd_smb2_check_message) that may lead to out-of-bounds access.

ksmbd: allocate one more byte for implied bcc[0]
ksmbd_smb2_check_message allows client to return one byte more, so we
need to allocate additional memory in ksmbd_conn_handler_loop to avoid
out-of-bound access.
