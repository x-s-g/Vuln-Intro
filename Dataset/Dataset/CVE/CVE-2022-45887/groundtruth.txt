Description
An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.9. drivers/media/usb/ttusb-dec/ttusb_dec.c has a memory leak because of the lack of a dvb_frontend_detach call.

media: ttusb-dec: fix memory leak in ttusb_dec_exit_dvb()
Since dvb_frontend_detach() is not called in ttusb_dec_exit_dvb(),
which is called when the device is disconnected, dvb_frontend_free()
is not finally called.

This causes a memory leak just by repeatedly plugging and
unplugging the device.

Fix this issue by adding dvb_frontend_detach() to ttusb_dec_exit_dvb().
