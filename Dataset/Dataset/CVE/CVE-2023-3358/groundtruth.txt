Description
A null pointer dereference was found in the Linux kernel's Integrated Sensor Hub (ISH) driver. This issue could allow a local user to crash the system.

HID: intel_ish-hid: Add check for ishtp_dma_tx_map
As the kcalloc may return NULL pointer,
it should be better to check the ishtp_dma_tx_map
before use in order to avoid NULL pointer dereference.
