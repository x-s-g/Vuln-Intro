Description
In the Linux kernel before 5.17.2, drivers/soc/qcom/qcom_aoss.c does not release an of_find_device_by_node reference after use, e.g., with put_device.

soc: qcom: aoss: Fix missing put_device call in qmp_get
The reference taken by 'of_find_device_by_node()' must be released when
not needed anymore.
Add the corresponding 'put_device()' in the error handling paths.
