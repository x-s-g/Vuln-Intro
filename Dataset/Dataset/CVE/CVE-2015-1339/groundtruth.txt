Description
Memory leak in the cuse_channel_release function in fs/fuse/cuse.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by opening /dev/cuse many times.

cuse: fix memory leak
The problem is that fuse_dev_alloc() acquires an extra reference to cc.fc,
and the original ref count is never dropped.
