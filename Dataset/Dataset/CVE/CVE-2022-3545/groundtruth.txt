Description
A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function area_cache_get of the file drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/nfpcore/nfp_cppcore.c of the component IPsec. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211045 was assigned to this vulnerability.

nfp: fix use-after-free in area_cache_get()
area_cache_get() is used to distribute cache->area and set cache->id,
 and if cache->id is not 0 and cache->area->kref refcount is 0, it will
 release the cache->area by nfp_cpp_area_release(). area_cache_get()
 set cache->id before cpp->op->area_init() and nfp_cpp_area_acquire().

But if area_init() or nfp_cpp_area_acquire() fails, the cache->id is
 is already set but the refcount is not increased as expected. At this
 time, calling the nfp_cpp_area_release() will cause use-after-free.

To avoid the use-after-free, set cache->id after area_init() and
 nfp_cpp_area_acquire() complete successfully.

Note: This vulnerability is triggerable by providing emulated device
 equipped with specified configuration.
