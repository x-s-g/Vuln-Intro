Current Description
In the Linux kernel before 6.2, mm/memory-tiers.c misinterprets the alloc_memory_type return value (expects it to be NULL in the error case, whereas it is actually an error pointer). NOTE: this is disputed by third parties because there are no realistic cases in which a user can cause the alloc_memory_type error case to be reached.

mm/demotion: fix NULL vs IS_ERR checking in memory_tier_init
alloc_memory_type() returns error pointers on error instead of NULL.  Use
IS_ERR() to check the return value to fix this.
