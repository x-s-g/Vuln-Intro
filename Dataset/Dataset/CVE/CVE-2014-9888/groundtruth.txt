Description
arch/arm/mm/dma-mapping.c in the Linux kernel before 3.13 on ARM platforms, as used in Android before 2016-08-05 on Nexus 5 and 7 (2013) devices, does not prevent executable DMA mappings, which might allow local users to gain privileges via a crafted application, aka Android internal bug 28803642 and Qualcomm internal bug CR642735.

ARM: dma-mapping: don't allow DMA mappings to be marked executable
DMA mapping permissions were being derived from pgprot_kernel directly
without using PAGE_KERNEL.  This causes them to be marked with executable
permission, which is not what we want.  Fix this.
