Description
A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's netdevsim device driver, within the scheduling of events. This issue results from the improper management of a reference count. This may allow an attacker to create a denial of service condition on the system.

netdevsim: fib: Fix reference count leak on route deletion failure
As part of FIB offload simulation, netdevsim stores IPv4 and IPv6 routes
and holds a reference on FIB info structures that in turn hold a
reference on the associated nexthop device(s).

In the unlikely case where we are unable to allocate memory to process a
route deletion request, netdevsim will not release the reference from
the associated FIB info structure, thereby preventing the associated
nexthop device(s) from ever being removed [1].

Fix this by scheduling a work item that will flush netdevsim's FIB table
upon route deletion failure. This will cause netdevsim to release its
reference from all the FIB info structures in its table.
