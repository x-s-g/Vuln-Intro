Current Description
A vulnerability exists in kernel/time/clocksource.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.34 where on non-GENERIC_TIME systems (GENERIC_TIME=n), accessing /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource results in an OOPS.

timekeeping: Prevent oops when GENERIC_TIME=n
Aaro Koskinen reported an issue in kernel.org bugzilla #15366, where
on non-GENERIC_TIME systems, accessing
/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource
results in an oops.

It seems the timekeeper/clocksource rework missed initializing the
curr_clocksource value in the !GENERIC_TIME case.

Thanks to Aaro for reporting and diagnosing the issue as well as
testing the fix!
