Description
net/sunrpc/xdr.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (xdr_set_page_base slab-out-of-bounds access) by performing many NFS 4.2 READ_PLUS operations.

sunrpc: Avoid a KASAN slab-out-of-bounds bug in xdr_set_page_base()
This seems to happen fairly easily during READ_PLUS testing on NFS v4.2.
I found that we could end up accessing xdr->buf->pages[pgnr] with a pgnr
greater than the number of pages in the array. So let's just return
early if we're setting base to a point at the end of the page data and
let xdr_set_tail_base() handle setting up the buffer pointers instead.
