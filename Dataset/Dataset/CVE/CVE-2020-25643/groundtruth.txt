Description
A flaw was found in the HDLC_PPP module of the Linux kernel in versions before 5.9-rc7. Memory corruption and a read overflow is caused by improper input validation in the ppp_cp_parse_cr function which can cause the system to crash or cause a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

hdlc_ppp: add range checks in ppp_cp_parse_cr()
There are a couple bugs here:
1) If opt[1] is zero then this results in a forever loop.  If the value
   is less than 2 then it is invalid.
2) It assumes that "len" is more than sizeof(valid_accm) or 6 which can
   result in memory corruption.

In the case of LCP_OPTION_ACCM, then  we should check "opt[1]" instead
of "len" because, if "opt[1]" is less than sizeof(valid_accm) then
"nak_len" gets out of sync and it can lead to memory corruption in the
next iterations through the loop.  In case of LCP_OPTION_MAGIC, the
only valid value for opt[1] is 6, but the code is trying to log invalid
data so we should only discard the data when "len" is less than 6
because that leads to a read overflow.
