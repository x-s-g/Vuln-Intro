Description
An issue was discovered in drivers/scsi/aacraid/commctrl.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13. There is potential exposure of kernel stack memory because aac_get_hba_info does not initialize the hbainfo structure.

scsi: aacraid: Don't copy uninitialized stack memory to userspace
Both aac_send_raw_srb() and aac_get_hba_info() may copy stack allocated
structs to userspace without initializing all members of these
structs. Clear out this memory to prevent information leaks.
