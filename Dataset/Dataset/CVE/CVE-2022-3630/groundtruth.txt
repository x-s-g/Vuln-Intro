fscache: don't leak cookie access refs if invalidation is in progress or failed
It's possible for a request to invalidate a fscache_cookie will come in
while we're already processing an invalidation. If that happens we
currently take an extra access reference that will leak. Only call
__fscache_begin_cookie_access if the FSCACHE_COOKIE_DO_INVALIDATE bit
was previously clear.

Also, ensure that we attempt to clear the bit when the cookie is
"FAILED" and put the reference to avoid an access leak.
