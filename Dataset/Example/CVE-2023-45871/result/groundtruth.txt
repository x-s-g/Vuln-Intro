An issue was discovered in drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb_main.c in the IGB driver in the Linux kernel before 6.5.3. A buffer size may not be adequate for frames larger than the MTU.

igb: set max size RX buffer when store bad packet is enabled
Increase the RX buffer size to 3K when the SBP bit is on. The size of
the RX buffer determines the number of pages allocated which may not
be sufficient for receive frames larger than the set MTU size.
