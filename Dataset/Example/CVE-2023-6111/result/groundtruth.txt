Description
A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The function nft_trans_gc_catchall did not remove the catchall set element from the catchall_list when the argument sync is true, making it possible to free a catchall set element many times. We recommend upgrading past commit 93995bf4af2c5a99e2a87f0cd5ce547d31eb7630.

netfilter: nf_tables: remove catchall element in GC sync path
The expired catchall element is not deactivated and removed from GC sync
path. This path holds mutex so just call nft_setelem_data_deactivate()
and nft_setelem_catchall_remove() before queueing the GC work.
