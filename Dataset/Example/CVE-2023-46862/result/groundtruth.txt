Description
An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.5.9. During a race with SQ thread exit, an io_uring/fdinfo.c io_uring_show_fdinfo NULL pointer dereference can occur.

io_uring/fdinfo: lock SQ thread while retrieving thread cpu/pid
We could race with SQ thread exit, and if we do, we'll hit a NULL pointer
dereference when the thread is cleared. Grab the SQPOLL data lock before
attempting to get the task cpu and pid for fdinfo, this ensures we have a
stable view of it.
